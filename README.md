# Scenes-OpenDS

Scenes, which were used to conduct user studies, were released.

Motivation
============

This project aims to create 3D scene for OpenDS framework by using JMonkeyEngine SDK3. We upload the needed models and textures, the code to build scene and the corresponding generated scene file.

Introduction
============
We divided this part in three parts. For the first part, we represent the aim of this project and the choices of the design. The second part is about how you can import and run this project in your own computer. The last part is used to introduce some details about the code flie, which include Geometry, Texture, Models,Light and Export.

Goal
============

In this project, by using JMonkeyEngine SDK3, We can just use existing models or create the required models and combine to generate the scene which use be used in OpenDS. We can also set the physical effects of objects in the scene such as illumination and collision. Our goal is to use JMonkeyEngine SDK3 to build a scene that meets user requirements for this project.

Design_Choices
============

We design to built several scenes to study people's behavior in different scene. To simulate more realistic scenes, all objects in the scene are set proportional to the proportion in reality. For the first scene, the road we designed is two-way four-lane. We also design another scene with two-way eight-lane road. With different number of lanes, the driver may have different behaviors when encountering the same event such as being overtaken. We also add fence, tree and some road signs to make the scene more like the same world.
